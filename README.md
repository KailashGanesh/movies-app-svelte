# Movies app in svelteKit

made this project to learn sveltekit, this is just a replica of a older project I made in javascript - [movies-app](https://github.com/KailashGanesh/Movies-app)

I also deployed it with vercel - [movies-app](https://movies-app-svelte.vercel.app/)

it was a breeze to deploy with vercel. import the repo and it did the rest.
